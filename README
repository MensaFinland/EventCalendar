EventCalendar is a free JavaScript-based event calendar.

It is not an CMS-plugin.

To compile this, you need:
- Visual Studio 2012
- FunScript (F-Sharp to Javascirpt. FunScript uses F#-language, FSharp.Data. It has strongly typed libraries via TypeScript)
- The compiled version is available at demo-folder.

The runtime uses pure HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript with jQuery, jQuery-UI and Modernizer

Software features:
- Event list
- HTML5-Geolocation to find nearest events
- QR-Code generation: Get event details to your phone notification.
- Google maps to display locations of events
- Event calendar to show dates that has events (just JQuery datepicker)
- Ability to fetch Longitude/Latitude of items (not in UI)

But...
- There is not yet implementation of any way to fetch events: Now they are just JavaScript objects.
  I'm planning to make a PHP-page to generate the data (fetch from somewhere).
- If you have over 2000 visitors per day, I suppose Google will want something for using their APIs (Map, QR-code)
- UI is not yet fully localized to Finnish. ;-)
- I have tested this only with Internet Explorer 10, FireFox 20 and Chrome 26.
